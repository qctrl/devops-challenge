# Q-CTRL DevOps Engineering Challenge

The Q-CTRL DevOps Engineering Challenge is a way for applicants to roles within the Q-CTRL DevOps Engineering team to demonstrate their overall approach in creating solutions from a variety of requirements.

## The rules

- Read and understand [The challenge](#the-challenge).
- Create a solution that satisfies the [Requirements](#requirements).

## The challenge

**You are not expected to spend more than one hour on this task.**
- Using either AWS or GCP, create a website that displays some static text.
    - This text should include your name, e.g. “This is Mary Smith’s website”.
    - You will not be judged on your HTML skills.
    - Feel free to stick within the free/trial tiers for the resources you create.
- Create a public repo that includes all relevant code, and a README.md on how someone could replicate your website if required. Shortlisted candidates will have their instructions tested for accuracy and comprehensibility.
- Document what else you would do with your website, and how you would go about doing it, if you had more time.

### Requirements

Your solution must contain:
- All code used to create the site.
- Instructions to set up the site for ourselves.
- A section in your documentation outlining any improvements you would make to your solution as well as any alternative solutions.
