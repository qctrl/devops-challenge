# Q-CTRL DevOps Challenge

The Q-CTRL DevOps Challenge is a way for applicants to roles within the Q-CTRL DevOps Engineering team to demonstrate their skills and overall approach to solving a challenge based upon a set of requirements.

The requirements are intentionally sparse (the devil is in the details). We don't want you to do a lot, but what you do should be your best work and should clearly demonstrate you embody [the three virtues](https://thethreevirtues.com/).

## The rules

- Read and understand [the challenge](#the-challenge).
- Create a solution that satisfies [the requirements](#the-requirements).
- Send a link to the repository containing your solution to the person who contacted you.

**IMPORTANT:** The repository containing your solution must be public, must contain a `README.md` file, **MUST NOT** be a fork of this repository, and **MUST NOT** make any reference to "Q-CTRL" in the repository name, description, or code.

**Note:** You should spend no more than three hours on this challenge.

## The challenge

TODO.

### The requirements

- Using either AWS or GCP, create a website that displays some static text (you will not be judged on your HTML skills, and feel free to stick within the free/trial tiers for the resources you create).
- The text should include your name, e.g. “This is Mary Smith’s website”.
- Document:
  - What else you would do with your website, and how you would go about doing it if you had more time.
  - Alternative solutions that you could have taken but didn't and explain why.
  - What would be required to make this a production grade website that would be developed on by various development teams. The more detail, the better!
